## Basic encryption with OpenSSL

### OpenSSL commands

We use OpenSSL tool to encryption. The following command in the shell generate private.pem that contains a private key :
```
$ openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
```
Extract the public key :
```
$ openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```

### Illustration of the exercise

The exercise can be drawn as follow :
![Exercise 1](img/exercice1.png)

### The server.py and client.py files

The exercise involves 6 files :
* `server.py` : the server program
* `client.py` : the client program
* `private.pem` : the private key generated by the server using the OpenSSL command above
* `public.pem` : the public key generated by the server using the OpenSSL command above
* `file_to_send.txt` : file example that the client wants to send to the server
* `file_received.txt` : file written by the server, decrypting the data sent by the client

NB : `file_to_send.txt` and `file_received.txt` must be identical, otherwise the exercice is not correct and there is an error somewhere.


### To go further : secure shell

To go further, instead of sending files, we can send shell commands in remote to the server, execute the commands on the server and send back to the client what is printed. All the communication will be encrypted by the symmetric key generated by the client. It is quiet secure as the client transfered this symmetric key to server by signing it with the server's public key. So, in theory, the client and the server are the only one that know the symmetric key.

This exercice involves 2 files : 
* `server_shell.py` : the server program
* `client_shell.py` : the client program


In a terminal tab, run the server on which the shell commands will be executed : `python server_shell.py`. On another tab, run the  client that will send the shell commands to the server in remote : `python client_shell.py`. On the client tab, we have a shell interface like a real shell but the commands are executed on the server ! The shell returns error as well.
